Machine Learning-Driven User Interaction Analysis
This project involves designing and implementing a machine learning model to analyze interaction data from over 10,000 user sessions. The goal is to predict behavioral trends with high accuracy and generate actionable insights to improve user engagement metrics.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation: pandas
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

•	Designed and implemented a machine learning model that analyzed interaction data from over 10,000 user sessions, achieving a 92% accuracy in predicting behavioral trends.
•	Generated actionable insights that led to a redesign of key user interface components, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement metrics (e.g., click-through rates, session duration).
•	Utilized tools such as Python (scikit-learn, pandas) and visualization libraries to present findings, reducing analysis time by 30% compared to traditional methods.
